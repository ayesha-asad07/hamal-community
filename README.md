## Hamal Community

Pregnancy is a beautiful yet challenging journey, and every mom-to-be needs the right support, guidance, and a place to connect. This is a **community platform** where pregnant women can find answers, share experiences, and get expert advice.  

## Vision

By leveraging **technology and human connection**, we aim to:  
- **Empower** women with accurate and helpful information.  
- **Encourage** meaningful conversations and peer support.  
- **Ensure** that every mother-to-be has access to a caring and knowledgeable community.  

I hope to **grow this platform** into a **go-to pregnancy resource**, making a real difference in the lives of mothers worldwide.  


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
